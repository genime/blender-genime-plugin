# Blender Genime Plugin

## Description
Blender Genime Plugin is an innovative tool that integrates generative AI capabilities into Blender. This plugin enhances the creative workflow by allowing artists to generate, manipulate, and enhance animations directly within Blender using AI-powered techniques.

## Features
- Seamless integration with Blender's interface.
- AI-powered keyframe in-betweening (currently for 2D animation).
- Managed hosting (beta).

3. Download the latest release of the Blender Genime Plugin from [here](https://github.com/genime/blender-genime-plugin/blob/main/genime_plugin.py).
4. Now, start Blender and go to `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `Add-ons` -> `âŒ„` (top right)-> `Install from Disk`. Select `genime_plugin.py`.
